# Libraries

Needs the PoisFFT package

https://github.com/LadaF/PoisFFT

You can install the library locally and add it to your path.
E.g. Add the following to your .bashrc file:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/pmocz/PoisFFT/lib/gcc:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
To install this library, in your directory for libraries, you can do 
```
git clone https://github.com/LadaF/PoisFFT.git
cd PoisFFT/
cd src/
scons
```

Also needs hdf5, fftw3

You will have to modify the Makefile to point to your library installations

# How to run

recompile and run:
```
make clean; make; ./IntegerLattice 
make clean; make run
```

to run and make plots:
```
make clean; make simulation
```

to run in parallel (METHOD_MEMSAVE only):
```
mpirun -n 4 ./IntegerLattice
```

to compile job on odyssey:
```
./makeOdyssey.sh 
```

to submit job to a queue (e.g. odyssey cluster):
```
sbatch submit.sh
```


to plot snapshots (e.g. snaps 0, 10, 20, 30), 
in the analysis/ folder, run the python script:
```
python plot.py 0 10 20 30
```
or, to plot the snapshots run in parallel mode (split files), run:
```
python plotParallel.py 0 10 20 30
```
